\section{Cell Class}

This class is simply a cell on a connect 4 board where a token would be. It can only have 3 values:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 0: empty
  \item 1: player 1's token
  \item 2: player 2's token
\end{itemize}


The Class has the following methods:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
getState() # returns the integer value of the cell
printState() # returns a character representation of the cell: _, X, O
changeState() # changes the value of the cell only if it's has the value of 0 when called
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Board Class}

This class is the board, and where all the interaction will flow through. It has the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item cells: a 2d array of cells (7x6)
  \item turn: dictates which player's turn it is
  \item players: a list of length 2 which stores the player objects
\end{itemize}


The Class has the following methods:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
getBoard() # prints out a graphical representation of the board
changeTurn() # alternates the turn between 1 and 2
play() # takes as input the index of column and plays
checkWin() # checks for possible win by calling the following four methods:
rowWin() # horizontal
colWin() # vertical
diagWin1() # \

This class is an actual human player. It has the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item can't think of a necessary variable atm
\end{itemize}


The Class has the following methods:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
getInput() # asks for a play from the player and will only accept a valid response. Will ask again if necessary. 
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ComputerPlayer Class}

This class is an actual human player. It has the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item difficulty: how smart or dumb this computer will play
\end{itemize}


The Class has the following methods:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
getPlayDumb() # will play randomly
getPlaySmart() # takes an integer as input to decide how far to search with a minmax algorithm
\end{lstlisting}
